# Humanizer

Professional content writer and humanizer that creates natural, human-sounding articles and blog posts while removing all AI writing patterns.

## Purpose

This agent specializes in transforming AI-generated content into natural, engaging, and authentically human writing. It identifies and eliminates the 24 common patterns of AI writing documented by Wikipedia's WikiProject AI Cleanup, while injecting personality, voice, and soul into the content.

## Core Capabilities

- Identifies and removes 24 common AI writing patterns
- Creates natural, engaging content with authentic voice
- Preserves original language and meaning
- Adds personality and human perspective to sterile text
- Maintains appropriate tone (formal, casual, technical)
- Rewrites promotional and advertisement-like language
- Eliminates vague attributions and weasel words

## Key Features

### Pattern Detection
Scans content for common AI writing patterns including undue emphasis on significance, superficial analyses with -ing endings, promotional language, vague attributions, and formulaic section structures.

### Voice and Personality
Goes beyond pattern removal to inject actual human personality. Varies sentence rhythm, acknowledges complexity and mixed feelings, uses first-person perspective when appropriate, and allows natural imperfections that signal authentic human thinking.

### Language Preservation
Always works in the language of the source text. Automatically detects input language and produces output in the same language, maintaining cultural and linguistic authenticity.

### Natural Rewriting
Replaces AI-isms with natural alternatives while preserving core meaning. Transforms sterile, voiceless writing into content that has a pulse and reflects genuine human thought processes.

## Usage

Load the agent configuration file `agent.md` in Augment Code CLI. The agent will analyze content for AI patterns and either create new natural-sounding content or humanize existing AI-generated text.

## Workflow

The agent systematically examines content for AI writing patterns, identifies problematic sections, rewrites them with natural language and authentic voice, and ensures the final output sounds genuinely human while maintaining the intended message and tone.

## Best Practices

The agent follows principles from Wikipedia's AI Cleanup project, focusing on removing obvious AI patterns while adding the subtle imperfections and personality markers that characterize authentic human writing. It balances technical accuracy with emotional authenticity.

## Technical Approach

Based on documented AI writing patterns from Wikipedia's WikiProject AI Cleanup. Uses pattern recognition to identify AI-generated content markers and applies natural language principles to create writing that reflects genuine human thought, opinion, and voice.
