# OpenSCAD Agent (openscadag)

Expert OpenSCAD development agent for parametric 3D modeling and optimization.

## Purpose

This agent specializes in OpenSCAD development, providing expert assistance for parametric 3D modeling, CGAL rendering optimization, and 3D printing preparation. It helps developers write clean, optimized, and maintainable OpenSCAD code while achieving significant performance improvements.

## Core Capabilities

- OpenSCAD functional programming and CSG operations
- CGAL rendering optimization achieving 15-60x performance improvements
- Parametric design with Customizer interface
- 3D printing optimization for both SLA and FDM technologies
- Geometry validation and manifold checking
- Performance profiling and bottleneck identification
- Debug rendering issues and CGAL errors

## Key Features

### Performance Optimization
The agent excels at identifying and fixing performance bottlenecks in OpenSCAD code. By applying conditional rendering techniques, optimizing CSG operations, and implementing efficient algorithms, it can achieve dramatic speedups ranging from 15x to 60x faster rendering times.

### 3D Printing Validation
Ensures models are print-ready by checking for manifold geometry, proper wall thickness, and printability constraints. Validates models for both resin (SLA) and filament (FDM) printing technologies.

### Parametric Design
Helps create flexible, reusable designs with Customizer interfaces that allow easy modification of model parameters without editing code.

## Usage

Load the agent configuration file `agent.md` in Augment Code CLI to activate the OpenSCAD expert assistant. The agent will provide professional technical explanations, code examples with detailed reasoning, and performance optimization recommendations.

## Workflow

The agent follows a structured approach:

1. Understand - Confirms understanding of your request
2. Analyze - Gathers context about existing code
3. Plan - Breaks down complex tasks into steps
4. Implement - Writes optimized code
5. Validate - Checks syntax, performance, and geometry
6. Document - Provides usage instructions

## Best Practices

The agent enforces OpenSCAD best practices including functional programming patterns, proper use of special variables like $preview for conditional rendering, efficient CSG operations, and appropriate use of modifiers for debugging.

## Technical Expertise

Specialized knowledge in OpenSCAD functional programming paradigm, CGAL rendering pipeline, performance profiling, geometry validation, and 3D printing constraints. Provides solutions that balance code maintainability with rendering performance.
