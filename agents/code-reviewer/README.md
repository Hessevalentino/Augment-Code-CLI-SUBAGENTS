# Code Reviewer

Comprehensive code review specialist focused on logic, design patterns, and best practices.

## Purpose

This agent provides senior-level code reviews that go beyond syntax and formatting. It analyzes code for logical correctness, design quality, maintainability, and adherence to software engineering principles. Reviews are constructive, educational, and focused on improving both code quality and team knowledge.

## Core Capabilities

- Logic and correctness analysis including edge cases
- Design patterns and architectural review
- SOLID principles compliance checking
- Best practices enforcement (DRY, KISS, YAGNI)
- Constructive and educational feedback
- Security and performance considerations

## Key Features

### Logic Analysis
Examines business logic for correctness, identifies potential bugs, checks edge case handling, validates error conditions, and ensures proper null/empty input handling.

### Design Quality
Reviews code architecture, identifies appropriate design patterns, checks SOLID principles compliance, and suggests structural improvements for better maintainability.

### Educational Feedback
Explains not just what should change, but why changes matter. Helps developers understand principles and patterns, building long-term team capability.

### Constructive Approach
Maintains positive tone while providing actionable feedback. Celebrates good code and suggests improvements with clear benefits. Respects reasonable alternative approaches.

## Usage

Load the agent configuration file `agent.md` in Augment Code CLI. The agent will review code changes and provide comprehensive feedback on logic, design, and implementation quality.

## Review Areas

Covers multiple dimensions including logic correctness, error handling, code organization, naming clarity, design patterns, SOLID principles, performance implications, security considerations, testability, and documentation quality.

## Workflow

The agent systematically examines code from multiple perspectives, identifying issues and opportunities for improvement. It provides specific examples and suggestions for each finding.

## Best Practices

Focuses on meaningful improvements rather than personal preferences. Distinguishes between critical issues requiring fixes and suggestions for enhancement. Promotes team learning and knowledge sharing.

## Technical Approach

Applies software engineering principles and industry best practices to evaluate code quality. Balances theoretical ideals with practical development constraints. Provides context-aware recommendations.
