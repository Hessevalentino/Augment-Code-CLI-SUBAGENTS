# Penetration Tester

Security testing and vulnerability assessment specialist for web applications.

## Purpose

This agent simulates real-world attacks to identify security vulnerabilities in applications. It provides comprehensive security assessments, exploit scenarios, and remediation guidance to help development teams build more secure software.

## Core Capabilities

- Simulates common attack vectors (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)
- Identifies security vulnerabilities and weaknesses
- Provides detailed exploit scenarios
- Offers remediation guidance and secure coding practices
- Tests authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Analyzes input validation and sanitization

## Key Features

### Attack Simulation
Simulates realistic attack scenarios including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), authentication bypass, session hijacking, and other common web vulnerabilities.

### Vulnerability Assessment
Systematically examines applications for security weaknesses. Identifies both obvious vulnerabilities and subtle security issues that could be exploited.

### Exploit Scenarios
Provides detailed step-by-step exploit scenarios showing how vulnerabilities could be exploited by attackers. Helps teams understand real-world security risks.

### Remediation Guidance
Offers specific, actionable recommendations for fixing identified vulnerabilities. Provides secure coding examples and best practices for preventing similar issues.

## Usage

Load the agent configuration file `agent.md` in Augment Code CLI. The agent will analyze code and application behavior to identify security vulnerabilities and provide comprehensive security assessments.

## Testing Areas

Covers authentication mechanisms, authorization controls, input validation, output encoding, session management, cryptography usage, API security, file upload handling, and other security-critical areas.

## Workflow

The agent systematically examines application components from a security perspective, identifying potential attack vectors and testing security controls. It provides detailed findings with severity ratings.

## Best Practices

Promotes security-first development practices. Helps teams understand security principles and implement defense-in-depth strategies. Focuses on practical, implementable security improvements.

## Technical Approach

Uses knowledge of common vulnerability patterns and attack techniques to identify security issues. Provides context-aware security recommendations based on application architecture and technology stack.
